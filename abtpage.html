        <h1>About the Project</h1>

        <div class="project-description">
            <p>This project is a culmination of our final requirements for the <strong>Introduction to Computing</strong> course at Ateneo de Davao University. As part of the subject, we were tasked with creating a functional website that contains four distinct assignments that demonstrate our understanding and application of basic computing principles. These assignments were designed to cover fundamental concepts in programming, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conversion Page:</strong> A tool that allows users to convert values from one unit to another, demonstrating our understanding of user input and processing data.</li>
                <li><strong>Income Tax Calculator:</strong> A system designed to calculate the income tax based on a given taxable income, allowing us to apply logic and functions in programming.</li>
                <li><strong>Loops:</strong> A section showcasing the use of loops, an essential concept in programming, to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Payroll:</strong> A payroll calculator for employees, further expanding our skills in handling more complex calculations and user interactions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-details">
            <p>We were given a specific timeframe to complete this project, which allowed us to demonstrate not only our technical skills but also our ability to manage time and prioritize tasks effectively. The entire website was developed using <strong>HTML</strong> for the structure, <strong>CSS</strong> for the styling, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for the functionality, including user interactions and dynamic content.</p>

            <p>Throughout the development process, we utilized online resources and our course materials to solve problems and improve our understanding of the concepts. Additionally, this project was an opportunity for us to practice version control by uploading our work to <strong>GitHub</strong>, where we could manage and track changes while collaborating effectively. This approach not only ensured that we could showcase our work but also allowed us to familiarize ourselves with a crucial tool used in software development.</p>

            <p>As the final project for the course, this website serves as a comprehensive demonstration of the knowledge and skills we have gained throughout the semester. It reflects our ability to apply various programming concepts in real-world scenarios and prepares us for more advanced topics in the field of computing and information technology.</p>
